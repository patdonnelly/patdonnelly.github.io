I am a graduate student at the University of Washington in the Department of Speech & Hearing Sciences.  Under the advisement of Dr. Jason Yeatman in the Brain Development & Education Lab at the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences, my research focuses on reading development, literacy, and dyslexia.  My specific interest is the development of fluent reading and harnessing technology to universalize evidence-based instruction.
