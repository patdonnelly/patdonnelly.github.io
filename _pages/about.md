Welcome to my website! Iâ€™m Patrick Donnelly and I am a graduate student at the University of Washington in the Department of Speech & Hearing Sciences.  Under the advisement of Dr. Jason Yeatman in the Brain Development & Education Lab at the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences, my research focuses on reading development, literacy, and dyslexia.  My specific interest is the development of fluent reading and harnessing technology to universalize evidence-based instruction.  The purpose of this website is to share my research and the work of my lab, as well as to comment on scholarship, media, and other sources that inspire me.  Thanks for visiting!
